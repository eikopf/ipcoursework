hi firat :)

sorry, but this project will probably require you to install
Python 3.11 (mainly for the match statements). also, i think
there might be some issues with this version of matplotlib?
i've noticed some memory leaks that it caused, in any case.

brag sheet:
- dynamic search! just type into the search box and go
- keyboard integration; in particular on the In/Out window
- multiple dynamic matplotlib figures
    - there are two on the Order window, and one in
      the recommendation section.
- very stable (feel free to throw malformed strings into entries)
- batch and single-item operations in the In/Out window!
- click to select items in the In/Out window
- levenshtein string metric used to sort search results well

with a little more time, I might have made everything look nicer,
but even i have to sleep at some point. still, i've ensured color
and font consistency across the whole application.
