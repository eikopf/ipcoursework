# Introduction to Programming Coursework
#### Oliver Wooding

>This project specifically targets Python 3.11+

This was my submission for the coursework component of a class 
called __Introduction to Programming__ at Loughborough, during 
the first semester of the 2022-2023 academic year. The 
premise was that we had to produce a 'library tool,' modelling 
both a database and actions on the database with text files.

Beyond learning Python, this was also a project intended to 
teach `tkinter` and `matplotlib`, by requiring their usage to 
get the highest possible grade.
