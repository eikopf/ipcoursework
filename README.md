Some pieces of this project that are especially of note:
- In `bookSearch.py`, I use some quite complicated string parsing so that inputs can be naturalistic.
  - Try an example like `books  by philipp dettmer in non-fiction` to see this in practice.
- The script that needs to be executed to demonstrate the app in its entirety is `menu.py`.

Also, the weird collection of books being used for the 
data here is from my collection!
