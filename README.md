>This project targets Python 3.10+, but has no dependencies other than `matplotlib`

Some pieces of this project that are especially of note:
- In `bookSearch.py`, I use some quite complicated string parsing so that inputs can be naturalistic.
  - Try an example like `books  by philipp dettmer in non-fiction` to see this in practice.
- While I can't overstate my hatred for `tkinter`, I am quite proud what I've done with it, especially without being able to use the `class` keyword.

Also, the weird collection of books being used for the data here is from my collection!
