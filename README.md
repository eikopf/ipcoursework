Some pieces of this project that are especially of note:
- In `bookSearch.py`, I use some quite complicated string parsing so that inputs can be naturalistic
  - Try an example like `books  by philipp dettmer in non-fiction` to see this in practice
- â€¦

Also, the weird collection of books being used for the data here are from my collection!
